         - for every caracalla failure, sign off on test results if they fail.
         - if there are too many failures on branches **including master** , disable the jenkins job and investigate.
         - frequently ( once a week ) run the ansible script for vm maintenance.

      - more infrastrucure for parallel tests.
   -  Are the vms working for us?
      - do we need to dockerize?
      - investigation needed - can we run multiplie tests on the same server if we dockerize?
